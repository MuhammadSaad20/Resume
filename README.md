# Resume

## About 📄

This repository contains the source code from my `Overleaf` project that was used to generate my resume. ✒️

I am uploading it to here for version control purposes and to make it public for use. 🌍

### Inspiration

This resume itself is based on [Deedy's CV](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/deedy-cv/bjryvfsjdyxz), but introduces slight variation with font family, font size, color, spacing, 2 column grid size, headings/subheadings visual.

Much thanks to Deedy. 👋


## Getting Started 🏎

To use this template for **_your own resume_**,

1. Clone this project to your machine  or download repository as ZIP

6. Make the necessary changes. You will only ever need to modify `saad.tex`. If you feel confident enough, you can modify `openfont.cls` to adjust fonts, font size, colors, etc
7. When you're done making the necessary changes, press `Ctrl+S` to generate the output. Keep making changes until satisfaction
8. Enjoy!
