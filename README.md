# Resume

This is my resume, uploading to version control changes and to make it public for use.

The PDF is under `dist/`.

If you like to be more interactive, please download the PDF and hover your mouse over the bolded text or generally just hover over the text on the resume.

The links I tried to highlight them with SkyBlue, like some sections can be seen. Some links I'm unable to highlight in blue for some reason in LaTeX, not sure why though.
